## Description

This was a project based of Pragmatic Programmers Domain Languages topic done to:

1. Understand the use of Domain Languages and gain an understanding of how they may be implemented and even useful in the real world

2. Learn Go and continue to explore the language's capabilites

## Results

I read online that in a way, everything above binary is like a Domain Language, achieving a lesser degree of complexity while still allowing the user the functionality of what you want. I can appreciate languages like SQL, HTML, Verilog are essentially widely used DLs. At the same time the book refers to DLs as a way to allow people outside of engineering roles to access the functionality you intended for things like testing or just demoing but I'm not entirely convinced on the usefulness or likelihood of non-programmers finding accesbility in something like this.

## Future Steps

I would like to actually use Go's image package to generate very basic rectangles based of the input from the DL
